# Application Description
Lightweight Vulnerability Scanner (LVS) is a new open-source penetration testing toool which can help in discovering OWASP identified web and API based vulnerabilities. The reason for the name is such that LVS takes the approach of targeted analysis using smaller data sets for testing so as to limit its footprint when scanning. Moreover, LVS is not positioned to be a replacement of current and established penetration testing tools, but is meant to offer a solution for initial attack surface analysis.
